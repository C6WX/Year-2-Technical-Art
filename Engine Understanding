## Nanite and the Rendering Pipeline


## Introduction (100-150 words) (94 words)

Nanite, Unreal Engine 5's virtualised geometry system, represents a fundemental shift in the rendering pipeline by redefining how high detail 3D assets are processed, optimised and displayed in real time.
While both Nanite and teh traditional rendering pipeline aim to take everthing in a scene and render it on screen, they achieve this in very different ways, each with it own advantages and limitations. This essay will examine how Nanite fits into the rendering pipeline, compare it with the conventional geometry handling and evaluate the benefits, drawbacks and most suitable applications of each approach.

## Background/Historical Context (150-200 words)
*Assessment Focus: Exploring + Connecting*

- Provide technical foundation and definitions
- Explain the evolution or current state of the technology
- Reference key developments or milestones
- Use academic and industry sources to support claims

**Research Integration:**
- Include at least 2-3 academic or industry sources
- Use inline citations: "According to Smith (2023), [concept]..."
- Reference technical documentation, GDC talks, or research papers

## Critical Analysis (300-400 words)
*Assessment Focus: Exploring + Connecting + Situating*

This is the core of your essay. Address multiple perspectives:

### Technical Perspective
- How does the technology work?
- What are the technical advantages and limitations?
- Include specific examples from game engines (Unity, Unreal, etc.)

### Industry Practice
- How do professional studios implement this?
- What workflows or best practices have emerged?
- Reference real game examples or case studies

### Critical Considerations
- Performance implications
- Accessibility for different team sizes/budgets
- Platform-specific considerations
- Environmental/ethical considerations (e.g., power consumption, accessibility)

**Use subheadings** to organize complex analysis:
```markdown
### Performance Trade-offs
[Analysis content...]

### Workflow Implications
[Analysis content...]
```


## Future Implications/Conclusion (100-150 words)
*Assessment Focus: Synthesizing + Situating*

- Synthesize your key findings
- Discuss future trends or developments
- Consider broader implications for the industry
- Reflect on what this means for technical artists
- End with a strong concluding statement

Example:
> "The evolution of [topic] demonstrates how technical art continues to bridge..."
