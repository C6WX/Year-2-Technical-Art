## Introduction (100-150 words)
*Assessment Focus: Exploring + Synthesizing*

- **Hook**: Open with a compelling statement or industry example
- **Context**: Briefly introduce the topic and its relevance to technical art
- **Thesis Statement**: Clearly state your main argument or perspective
- **Roadmap**: Outline what the essay will cover

Example opening:
> "As game engines evolve, [topic] has become increasingly critical for..."


## Background/Historical Context (150-200 words)
*Assessment Focus: Exploring + Connecting*

- Provide technical foundation and definitions
- Explain the evolution or current state of the technology
- Reference key developments or milestones
- Use academic and industry sources to support claims

**Research Integration:**

## Critical Analysis (300-400 words)
*Assessment Focus: Exploring + Connecting + Situating*

This is the core of your essay. Address multiple perspectives:

### Technical Perspective
- How does the technology work?
- What are the technical advantages and limitations?
- Include specific examples from game engines (Unity, Unreal, etc.)

### Industry Practice
- How do professional studios implement this?
- What workflows or best practices have emerged?
- Reference real game examples or case studies

### Critical Considerations
- Performance implications
- Accessibility for different team sizes/budgets
- Platform-specific considerations
- Environmental/ethical considerations (e.g., power consumption, accessibility)

**Use subheadings** to organize complex analysis:
```markdown
### Performance Trade-offs
[Analysis content...]

### Workflow Implications

```


## Future Implications/Conclusion (100-150 words)
*Assessment Focus: Synthesizing + Situating*

- Synthesize your key findings
- Discuss future trends or developments
- Consider broader implications for the industry
- Reflect on what this means for technical artists
- End with a strong concluding statement

Example:
> "The evolution of [topic] demonstrates how technical art continues to bridge..."
