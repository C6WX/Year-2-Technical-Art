# Week 6 Task – Lighting and Nanite  
 

## Brief  
This week focuses on understanding modern lighting techniques, physically based lighting principles, and traditional baked lighting workflows. To deepen your theoretical knowledge, you are required to research and write a **1000 word essay** on **one** of the following topics.  

Your essay should demonstrate critical and creative inquiry, supported by research, and should contextualise your findings within the field of **technical art and games development**.

## Topics (choose one)  

### 1. Physically Based Lighting in AAA Game Production  
**Guiding questions:**  
- How do AAA studios implement physically based lighting (PBL) workflows in their production pipelines?  
- What are the key optimization considerations when using real-world light units (lux, candelas, lumens) and dynamic lighting in large-scale game environments?  
- What tools and workflows have emerged to help lighting artists work efficiently with PBL systems?  
- How does PBL affect cross-platform development (PC, console, mobile)?  
- What are the performance trade-offs between baked and dynamic PBL approaches in shipped AAA titles?  



### 2. The Evolution of Global Illumination in Real-Time Rendering  
**Guiding questions:**  
- How has Global Illumination (GI) evolved from pre-baked lightmaps to real-time solutions?  
- What were the technical limitations of early GI techniques (lightmaps, light probes, SSGI)?  
- How do modern solutions like Lumen, RTGI, and DDGI differ from previous approaches?  
- What are the performance implications of different GI techniques across hardware generations?  
- How do AAA and indie studios choose between GI techniques based on their project requirements?  
- What does the future of real-time GI look like with emerging hardware capabilities?  



### 3. Mobile Game Lighting: Balancing Visual Quality with Performance Constraints
**Guiding questions:**
- What are the primary lighting limitations on mobile platforms compared to PC/console?
- How do mobile game developers achieve compelling lighting within strict performance budgets?
- What baked vs dynamic lighting strategies are most effective for mobile games?
- How do successful mobile games (e.g., Genshin Impact, PUBG Mobile, Honkai: Star Rail) approach lighting optimization?
- What emerging mobile GPU features (e.g., ray tracing on flagship devices) are changing mobile lighting workflows?
- How do developers handle lighting scalability across diverse mobile hardware (flagship vs budget devices)?



### 4. Real-Time Reflections: Techniques, Trade-offs, and Artistic Control
**Guiding questions:**
- What are the different real-time reflection techniques available in modern engines (SSR, planar reflections, reflection captures, Lumen reflections, ray-traced reflections)?
- How do these techniques compare in terms of quality, performance cost, and limitations?
- What are the artistic and technical trade-offs when choosing reflection methods for different surfaces (water, glass, metal)?
- How do AAA studios combine multiple reflection techniques to achieve optimal results?
- What are the common artifacts and limitations of each technique, and how do artists work around them?
- How does the choice of reflection technique affect the overall lighting pipeline and performance budget?

## Assessment Criteria

Your work will be evaluated against the following four criteria:

- **Exploring**: Engaging in critical and creative inquiry through questioning, research, and analysis of lighting technologies, workflows, and optimization strategies.
- **Connecting**: Communicating ideas clearly while linking to industry practices, professional lighting workflows, and wider technical art contexts.
- **Situating**: Critically positioning your research within social, cultural, environmental, ethical, and professional frameworks (e.g., accessibility, power consumption, hardware requirements).
- **Synthesizing**: Bringing together research, case studies, and critical reflection into a cohesive, well-structured essay.
