## Asset Overview
When the right mouse button is held, a charge up animation will play and then change to a charging animation which continues to loop till the button is released. While the attack is being charged, a crack decal spawns behind the player and debris will start being thrown in the air from the crack while the camera also starts shaking. When the player releases the right mouse button, the debris stops spawning, the camera stops shaking, and the throw animation plays while a niagara system is spawned and shot forward in front of the player.
