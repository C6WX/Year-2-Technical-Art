## Ripple Effect 
For the ripple effect, I created two different ripples to give Cameron a choice of which he prefers.

### Ripple Effect 1 V1

#### Development Process

##### Niagara System

##### Niagara System Parameters

##### Implementation
The ripple effect can be easily implemented into a game by just having it spawn at an actor's location after they die.

### Crack In The Ground 1

#### Development Process

##### Crack 1 Texture V1 (Photoshop)
The reason that I didn't use the first version of the texture that I made is because it created a large mound in the centre of the material once parallax occlusion mapping was added.

### Crack In The Ground 2
The reason that I created a second one is because I didn't like the elevated section in the middle of the first crack that was caused by Photoshop during creation, so I decided to try again, using Designer instead of Photoshop. This crack took a few attempts to get working as I attempted to create it using a decal niagara system, however that caused a problem where the decal would be black instead of taking on the colour of the surface it is spawned on. To fix this, I just spawned the decal as a decal instead of using a niagara system.

#### Development Process

##### Crack 2 Texture (Designer)

##### Niagara System
At first, I created a niagara system for the crack but I decided to spawn a decal as the niagara system made the crack look dark instead of taking on the floor's colour, which is what just spawning the decal does.

### Movement and Jump Animations
For the movement animations, I downloaded a collection of movement and jumping animations and created omni-directional movement, where the animation changes based on the speed and direction that the player is moving, and the jumping animations use one animation that is broken down into three sections, with the player switching between them based on their velocity and wether they are on the ground or not.

#### Development Process


#### Final Result

### Attack Combo Animation
For the attacks, I downloaded a collection of animations that fit the request and then went over the animations with my client until the only animations left were the one's he wanted. This ended up leaving the combo with only three attacks.
