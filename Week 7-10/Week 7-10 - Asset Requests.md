# Week 7-10 - Asset Requests

**Callum Wade** **2404781** **12/11/25** 

**Client: Cameron Gildea**

**[Request Document](https://ucreative-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/2322268_students_ucreative_ac_uk/EdvLvx6UqlpMqSFkGqqkYycBbzzZW3iyfWnn-7DaSxcnPA?e=P9hHvU)**

## Client Communication <!-- S&G checked --> 
Whenever something wasn't clear from the request form, I emailed Cameron to clear up what was required of me. The main thing that I needed to ask about was the checking which style of visual effects or animations he preferred. An example of this is with the ripple effect. I created a two different effects based on the request he asked for and then asked for feedback on which one he preferred and if there was anything that he would like changing. Also when it came to the throw animation, I found two animations that I felt work well for the final throwing animation, one where the character thrusts their hands forwards in a ball-shaped form (this animation worked the best and worked well with the start and charge up animation), and another where the character throws from over their head, which fit the client's description the best.
<br>
The main challenges that I felt came up with communication between me and my client was mainly due to the time I had to wait for a response. As a lot of my emails were sent to ask for feedback, a long delay before getting a response meant that I couldn't always continue with what I was working on for quite some time. As a result, I would move onto something else to keep me busy but this normally lead to me doing too many things at once. An example of this is when i created both of the ripple effects, I sent an email with both of them in but as I couldn't just directly speak to or message my client, it took a while to get a response so I ended up moving onto the crack effects. When it came to this, I didn't find it a problem to be doing the ripple effects and cracks at the same time, but it mainly became difficult while I was waiting for a response while creating the animations as I was working on the movement animations, the jumping animations, the combat animations, and the rock throw animations all at once. However, the delay before I received a reply to my emails were not the fault of my client as he did say that he was working quite a lot which I could definitely understand and relate too.
<br>
One thing I found to be a challenge but also a benefit was writing professionally within the emails I sent. Writing professionally is not new to me at all, but it is a lot different to how I normally message Cameron so it definitely took some getting used to. However, I felt that it created a separate professional relationship between us that helped communication between us when discussing the requested assets.
<br>
After creating the assets for my client, I created hand-over documents to help him understand and implement the assets into his own project. These documents include a brief description of what each asset does, a guide to integrate the assets into his project, a customisation guide that showcases all the adjustable variables - to change different parts of the effects from their colour to their lifetime - and a description of what the blueprints that accompany the assets do. Because I did much more programming work than originally required, I made sure to go as in-depth as I possibly could in the blueprint descriptions so that my client could understand what I have done and know how to modify it if needed.

## Technical Problem-Solving

### The First Crack Texture and Parallax Occlusion Mapping <!-- S&G checked --> 
When I created the first version of the crack in the ground, I used Photoshop to build the texture before importing it into Unreal Engine and using parallax occlusion mapping and a Niagara System to create a crack behind the player when they charged up the rock throw. The problem that occured with this version - and was later fixed by using Designer instead of Photoshop with the second crack - was that the texture created by photoshop developed ab unintended bump in the centre when a stroke effect was added. Removing the effect would have fixed the issue, but the stroke was necessary for the crack to work properly with parallax occlusion mapping. 
<br>
As this wasn't working, I tried creating a new crack texture in Photoshop, since the texture is drawn manually so drawing a new one could fix the issue, however this still resulted in the same problem, although the bump was slightly smaller. Using designer to create another version of the crack completely avoided this issue and resulted in a far better texture overall, with minimal problems.
<br>

### Crack Version 2 Niagara System <!-- S&G checked --> 
After creating the second version on the crack in the ground, I created a new niagara system for it but instead of using a sprite renderer, I used a decal renderer for it. When the decal was spawned, it worked as intended in terms of where it was spawning, but it was appearing with a dark tint covering the surface it has spawned on. I knew it wasn't supposed to do this and instead blend with the surface colour as I had placed an example decal on the ground in the scene that doesn't use a niagara system. 
<br>
The first thing that I did to try and fix this issue is adjusting the colour controls inside the system. Unfortunatley, as it is a decal, none of the colour setting had any effect on the crack, no matter which colour is used. After experimenting with every colour setting available, researching decal rendering and asking for help - all without finding a solution - I ended up spawning the decal using the Spawn Decal at Location node as I knew that would work from having spawned an example crack in the scene.

### Camera Shake & A Delay Node<!-- S&G checked -->
For the rock throw animation request, I created a three-part animation sequence: one that played when the button is pressed, one that loops during the button being held and one that plays when the button is released. To go along with the rock throw, I added a camera shake so that it looks like the world is shaking. 
<br>
For my first version of the blueprint that played the animations, I used a Play Animation node that played that first animation when the button was pressed and then the second animation when the button was held. However, this caused the first animation to be skipped, as the second animation played straight after the first, cutting off the first. To fix this, I added a delay node before the second animation so that it waited before playing the next animation. 
<br>
This fixed the problem with the animations cutting each other off but caused another problem where the camera suddenly became extremely intense, making it impossible to see anything in the scene. This problem could have only been caused the delay node. 
<br>
To cut the delay out of the blueprint but still have the animations work, I moved the first animation node to play when the button is held, before the second animation, and then changed the play animation node to a play montage node so that I could use the On Blend Out output so that the second animation only plays after the first.
<br>
<br>


### Charge Up Loop Animation Not Looping<!-- S&G checked -->
After fixing the previous problem, I discovered a new problem with the loop animation, the animation would only play once and then force the player into a T-pose. The first solution I thought of was to make sure the animation was set to loop in the animation sequence, which it was. Then I tried using a Play Animation node to loop the animation but still ended up with the same result. After researching my problem, I found out that the likely cause of the problem is due to the animations conflicting with the character's locomotion state machine. To fix this, I added an extra state to the locomotion graph that used a variable from the player blueprint to play the looping animation while the player is holding the charge button and once the initial animation has finished. Adding the animation to the locomotion graph logic stopped the conflicting animations and fixed the problem.

### Plugins<!-- S&G checked --> 
When creating the plugins, I had quite a few problems with the multiple plugins I was creating. At first I tried to make the ripple effect plugin by advanced-copying all the files needed for the effect and the test map into the new plugin. For the test map I was going to have a combat enemy from the combat Unreal Engine variant, so I copied all the combat files into the plugin too. When I tested the test map in the original project, it worked perfectly fine, the player would spawn, they would attack the enemy and the enemy would die and spawn the ripple effect. 
<br>
However the problem arose when I tested it in a new project. After loading the test map, the combat enemy wouldn't spawn, and neither would the effect. I also received multiple error messages saying that files were missing. After checking what these errors referred to, it turned out that these files did exist in the project, but Unreal wanted them in different directories to where they actually were. To fix this, I moved the ripple material to the exact file it wanted. Unfortunately, the second missing file was for the combat enemy, which it wanted to be outside of the plugin, in a specific folder just like it was in my main project. I could've easily fixed this by creating that folder but that would mean that my client would have to manually adjust folders when importing the plugin. Because of this, I moved onto the next plugin and tried another method.
<br>
Instead of advanced copying the files into the plugin folders - creating multiples of the same file - I tried moving the original files directly into the plugins. This means that the only thing changing would be the directory of each file, not the file that each one now has to reference. Doing this should have solved the previous problem, as there would be no mismatched file references expecting assets to be in different places. I created another test map and tested the plugin in a new project. This time I received a blueprint error: every single reference in all of my blueprints had been reset to 'None'. 
<br>
This would mean that I would've had to set all the references again to test it and that my client would have to do the same thing. To try and fix this problem, I repackaged the plugin and made sure my importing method was correct, but that didn't work. So I then tried using the 'Update Redirector References' feature in Unreal Engine, but it made no difference, and the error remained. 
<br>
Due to this error happening a week before the client deadline, I decided to send my client the entire project instead of individual plugins, ensuring they had enought time to implement the requested assets.

## Workflow & Time Management<!-- S&G checked --> 
When it came to time management during this project, I felt like I had lots of room for improvement, but at the same time I felt like I did really well with the time I was given and the time I get to work on it. The main thing I would improve is the fact that I didn't use any form of time manager such as Trello. This is because I normally prefer to work on whatever I feel is most important first and then I work on it whenever I am able to until I have finished it or am unable continue, then I will move onto the next asset. Using a time management application would have likely helped me get things done at a better pace than I did but I normally prefer to work free from lots of small deadlines and instead just focusing on the main deadline since I don't have much time to get work done at the moment so I feel like I would miss the small deadlines. 
<br>
The first thing I did when starting this assignment was break the request form down into all the parts my client wanted made and then I got started on the ripple effect. After making two different effects to give my client a choice on which he preferred, I sent them to him via email and while waiting for a response, I moved onto the next thing. Normally after receiving feedback, I would finish the part of what I was working on and go back to what I was doing if major changes were required, like with what happened with the crack effect as photoshop ruined it's parallax occlusion mapping. This method isn't the best but has always worked for me as it feels natural while im working. I feel like this is where a time management application would have helped the most as it would have kept me more focused on one thing at a time. However a time management application doesn't account for waiting for responses from a client so it has its positives and negatives.

## Professional Practice<!-- S&G checked --> 
The main thing that you learn straight away when working with a client is that you aren't the only one relying on you to get this work done. Realising that you have an even earlier deadline than normal since your client needs the assets much earlier than the deadline can add pressure when you're working for them but proper time management and/or putting the time in as soon as possible is the best solution for this. I managed to get all the work done on time and after looking at my work load and who my client was, the pressure was alleviated almost instantly as I knew the client and knew I could get the work done even though it was quite a lot.
<br>
As well as realising that you have someone relying on you, you also have to rely on someone else to provide constant feedback on what you have done as the work doesn't need to be a certain way for you, but for your client. As I discussed previously, the communication between myself and my client was really professional and helpful but waiting for responses could take a while, which is the main thing you realise when working for someone else as everyone else has things to do too. 
<br>
A challenge that arises when you have to deliver to the client's specifications is the fact that you both have different images in mind of what is wanted from each assets. I was given a well written request document with a collection of references but there is a very high chance that we still have different visions of what is being requested. This is where communication really comes in helpful as you can ask and discuss each topic. Even with discussing each asset, it is always likely that we still have different images in mind for what each asset should be and look like which is where the main challenge lies. If the client was to make the assets themselves, they would get exactly what they wanted, but when working with someone else, that is nearly impossible and that is expected - someone else is hired to save time not get it perfect.

## Quality vs Deadline<!-- S&G checked --> 
As I had a large number of tasks to complete for my client, the balance between quality and meeting the deadlines was constantly on my mind. To manage this effectively, I made a habit of regularly sending updates on my progress through email after each task. This allowed my client to review the work in stages and ensured I could quickly move on the the next task without long periods of inactivity. Because this project involved direct collaboration with a client, maintaining a level of quality that met his expectations became a top priority. As a result, I had to put in much more of my own time than I usually would, just to make sure the quality was where he expected it to be.
